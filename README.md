Birthday Organizer

You know that person at your job who always takes care of everybody's birthday cards and thinks of a cute gift? I know her too, and I also saw her team forget about her on her own birthday. It was crushing for her and honestly, not cool for the team.

Relying on one person for all the birthday joy isn't fair. That's why I built Birthday Organizer – an app that lets team members sign up to be responsible for each other's birthday cards and gifts. This way, everyone gets their turn to organize and be celebrated, making sure no one gets forgotten.

Features

Add team members with their names and birthdays.

Automatically assign responsibilities to ensure everyone gets celebrated.

Ensure that the birthday person won't have to organize their own celebration.

Email notifications for team members:

Receive an email when assigned to a birthday.

Reminder emails one month and two weeks prior to the assigned birthday.

How to Use

Add your team members by filling in their name and birthday.

Click on "Assign Responsibilities" to generate the birthday assignments.

The app ensures that no one is responsible during their own birthday month, so everyone can relax and enjoy their day.

Team members will receive email notifications about their assigned birthdays, including reminders.

Motivation

This project was inspired by seeing a teammate who always took care of everyone's birthday but was left out on her special day. With Birthday Organizer, teams can ensure that celebrating each other is a shared responsibility, and no one gets left out.

Tech Stack

React for building the UI.

JavaScript for the application logic.
